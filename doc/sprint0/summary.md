## Part 1: The Project Objective
Objective: The objective of the project is to make an intuitive and user-friendly app for students to quickly and efficiently find study spaces on campus. The app will help students solve one of the most common challenges students face: finding suitable places to study in a large campus. Real-time information on available lecture halls, classrooms, and all other study spaces is provided, ensuring that underutilized places (such as empty lecture halls) turn out to be very resourceful as study spots. It also allows users to rate their overall experience on factors such as noise level, facilities, or seating comfort, hence allowing others to make informed choices based on what suits them best. Overall, this project aims to improve the experience of the student in finding a study area by reducing the time to search and increasing access to places that are conducive to productivity and focus.

## Part 2: The Key Personas
### Andrew, the Busy Commuter Student
 - Background: Andrew is a second-year commuter student who has a full schedule, balancing classes, assignments, and a part-time job. He often has gaps between classes and wants to use this time productively to complete assignments and stay on top of his workload.
 - Goals: Andrew wants to find a quiet, nearby study spot during breaks between classes to maximize his study time without wandering around campus.
 - Pain Points: Andrew struggles with:
     - Finding available study spaces that meet his preferences (quiet, close to his classes, adequate seating).
     - Losing time between classes looking for a place to work.
     - Being unproductive due to the lack of real-time information on study spot availability.
 - Motivations: Andrew is motivated to make the most of his time on campus. He values efficiency and wants to avoid unnecessary walking, as it eats into his study time and leaves him feeling rushed before his next class.

### Emily, the First-Year Student
 - Background: Emily is a first-year student who just started at York University and is unfamiliar with the campus layout. She's still adjusting to her new environment and often finds it overwhelming to locate places to study or relax.
 - Goals: Emily wants to easily navigate the campus and discover quiet, comfortable study spots without getting lost. As a new student, she’s looking for resources to help her feel more confident about where to go and how to find what she needs.
 - Pain Points: Emily struggles with:
     - Finding quiet and accessible study areas.
     - Feeling overwhelmed by the size and complexity of the campus.
     - Spending too much time searching for places and feeling stressed due to her lack of familiarity.
 - Motivations: Emily is motivated to have a smooth and enjoyable transition to university life. She wants to feel comfortable on campus and access resources that can help her study efficiently.

### Alex and Team, the Late-Night Study Group
 - Background: Alex is a third-year student who frequently works on group projects and often studies late into the night. He and his team members are looking for reliable, safe, and well-equipped study spaces for last-minute project sessions.
 - Goals: Alex and his group want to find 24-hour study spots on campus that have power outlets, enough seating for a group, and a safe environment to work late into the night.
 - Pain Points: The group struggles with:
     - Finding secure, accessible, and comfortable study spots at night.
     - Locating places with adequate facilities for group work, especially during late hours.
     - Concerns about campus safety at night and whether spots are open and secure.
 - Motivations: Alex and his team are motivated to complete their project efficiently and productively, even during late-night sessions. They value a study spot that allows them to focus without distractions, offers necessary resources, and feels safe.

## Part 3: The Key Scenarios
### Key Scenario 1: Gap Between Classes  
Andrew has a two-hour gap between his morning and afternoon lectures and needs a quiet place to work on his assignment. He goes to the website and selects filters for proximity, noise level, and seating availability. The website shows him that the nearby Curtis Lecture Hall is available and has low noise levels. Andrew is able to find a seat, set up his laptop, and work productively for an hour before his next class. The website’s real-time availability feature allows him to make a quick, informed decision, maximizing his time for studying and reducing unnecessary walking around campus.

### Key Scenario 2: Navigating the Campus as a New Student
Emily, a first-year student unfamiliar with the campus layout, often struggles to find quiet study spots. She opens the app and views a map of the campus, which shows available study spaces with color-coded icons. Emily sees an open study area in the Biology building, which she didn’t know had available study spots. She selects this option, and the app provides step-by-step directions to guide her to the spot. Thanks to this feature, Emily is able to find a quiet place to study without feeling lost or overwhelmed, making her transition to campus life smoother and more comfortable.

### Key Scenario 3: Late-Night Study Session
A group of students who are working on a group project decide to pull a late-night study session to finalize their work. They need a secure area, open for 24 hours, with facilities like power outlets and enough seating for the whole group. The website tells them which study spots are open 24 hours, so they can pick a study room in Vari Hall that's safe to access at night and has everything they need. By helping the group find a convenient and secure area to study, the website keeps them productive even in late hours and makes them feel secure about studying late on campus.

## Part 4: The Key Principles
Key Principle: User-Centric Design
The entire project focuses on a design that is user-centric and focused on simplicity, accessibility, and reliability. That means the website should not create any unnecessary barriers for the students to find suitable study spots. This means ensuring core information—availability, proximity, and characteristics of each study spot—are clear, accurate, and readily available within the interface. With ease of use in mind, the app can reduce frustration, save students time, and increase better campus-wide use of underutilized spaces.

The design also integrates features that are critical to students when making a fast decision, including real-time availability updates and filtering options on aspects such as noise levels, the number of seats, and access to facilities.
This aligns with the objective of creating a seamless experience that will minimize the need for students to randomly visit different locations. Additionally, through the feature of giving rates and feedback on study spots, the website turns into a collaborative platform where users help each other locate the best study environments, hence fostering a sense of community and shared experience on campus.

This will, in the end, reduce the stress of searching for study space and contribute to a supportive campus environment where students can readily have access to resources that contribute to academic success.
