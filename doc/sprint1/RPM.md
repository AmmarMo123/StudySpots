## Release goal
For sprint 1, we want to address user stories (2, 3, 4 and 10):
- Show Available Lecture Halls/Classrooms, Libraries and Cafes
- Show Lecture Halls/Classrooms, Libraries and Cafes Opening Soon
- Show Busy/Closed Lecture Halls/Classrooms, Libraries and Cafes
- Expand Building to See Availability of Specific Rooms in the Building

Firstly, we need to gather all data regarding the spots (lecture halls/classrooms, libraries and cafes) on campus, store it in our data base.

We need to show all this data in the front end, depending on the *current time*, to be able to identify which facilities are open, opening soon and closed, with clear indicators on the interface.

Users should be able to expand on each spot for more details (particular room of lecture hall, more information regarding available times, etc).

This will address the user stories highlighted above, and represents the core functionality of our project.

## Scope of project
**Objective**: Provide York University students with a real-time system to locate open, busy, or soon-to-be-available campus facilities.

**Deliverables**: Deliverables consist of the database with all the information required, as well as a UI to display it. User stories addressed and more details are discussed in the release goals section above. We are excluding all other user stories, to be addressed in future sprints.
