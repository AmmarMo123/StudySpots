● Reflect on how your team worked together.
 1) Team Organization: We organized the team through a mix of communication and project management tools. Discord was used for instant communication, while Trello helped us manage tasks, user stories, and track progress. Regular meetings helped align goals, set internal deadlines, and ensure everyone shared their progress and blockers.
 2) Decision-Making: Our decision-making process was collaborative and expertise-driven. Each team member was encouraged to share ideas and opinions. For specialized areas (e.g., backend, frontend, product management), we deferred to the expertise of the relevant member. For shared decisions, we went with the majority preference, which worked smoothly since our team had only three members.
 3) Prioritization and Points Estimation: We prioritized tasks based on the potential impact on users and business. High-value stories and tasks that unblocked others were prioritized. We didn’t need a formal voting system due to the small team size and mutual understanding, but we relied on majority preference in case of differing opinions.
 4) Meeting Frequency: We held a main sprint meeting at the start to align on values and goals, followed by daily standups (30 minutes to an hour) for four days to share progress and discuss blockers.
 Key Takeaways: Moving forward, we aim to focus more on clearly defining requirements and scope and further improving organization and time management to optimize efficiency.
● How did you organize the team? Which tools did you use, if any?
 - In this project, we used Discord for fast, real-time discussions and Trello to manage tasks visually, track progress, and keep everyone on the same page with regard to user stories. These tools allowed us to coordinate easily, set internal deadlines, and adapt to any changes that might arise during the sprint. It provided space for updates, feedback, and clarification on the tasks, making sure that everyone was on the same page regarding goals and progress.
 - We organized our team to leverage the strengths of each member. Each had a defined role: backend, frontend, or product management. This made sure that tasks were divided according to expertise. This method helped us avoid confusion, since everyone knew exactly what they were responsible for and was able to independently make decisions in their area.
● How did you make decisions?
 - We used an open style of communication, where every member of the team was free to express their own thoughts and opinions, ensuring that everyone's voice was heard. The decision-making was mostly expertise-based; for example, the backend specialist had the say in database-related decisions, and the frontend specialist had the say in design decisions. This way, each of the team members was able to decide what was best from a skill set and with the support of the team. Where decisions were broader or we had equal capabilities, we followed the majority vote. With the team size of three, this way ensured the decisions were quick, without resorting to a formal voting system, and still maintained the overall preferences of the team.
● How did you define priority and/or points of user stories? How many rounds of voting (on average) did you need to come to a consensus for the point estimate?
 - We have prioritized the user stories based on impact and business value. High-priority tasks included core features that were central to the user experience and tasks that would unlock other stories or tasks in our backlog. This will ensure that we address the most valuable and impactful tasks first, optimizing our efforts to make the most progress and avoiding bottlenecks. While we did not need to develop a voting system, we did communicate freely about priorities and easily came into alignment about what was most important. This informal consensus worked well with our team size and allowed us to move ahead without any delays or misunderstandings regarding priority.
● How frequently did you meet?
 - We had in place a meeting structure that combined strategic planning with daily coordination. At the initiation of the sprint, we held a main planning meeting where we set our goals, defined the project values, and agreed on specific goals. Having this kick-off ensured that everybody was clear about how the sprint would go. Then we followed it with daily standups: fast 30-minute to 1-hour meetings for four consecutive days. These daily check-ins allowed us to share progress, address any blockers, and adjust tasks if needed. At this cadence of regular meetings, we could be agile and adaptive to changes while still holding each other accountable to the goals of the sprint.
● What lessons should you take forward to the next phase?
 - Looking ahead, it became very clear how important it was to have the best-defined requirements and scope from the get-go to ensure that no miscommunication or scope creep would befall our project. We will spend more time perfecting these details at the start of the sprint so that the project stays on course. Our organization and time management will also be improved further with more detailed time allocations per task in order to make the most progress possible. We will continue to use the tools and structures that worked well, such as Trello and regular standups, but with even more focus on maximizing productivity and clarity.
