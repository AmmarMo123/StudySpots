## Part 1: The Project Objective
Objective: The objective of the project is to make an intuitive and user-friendly app for students to quickly and efficiently find study spaces on campus. All in all, the app will help students solve one of the most common challenges students face: finding suitable places to study amidst a busy schedule and a large campus layout. In this way, through this project, real-time information on available lecture halls, classrooms, and all other study spaces is provided, ensuring that underutilized places—like those filled with empty lecture halls—turn out to be very resourceful as study spots. It also allows users to rate their overall experience on factors such as noise level, facilities, or seating comfort, hence allowing others to make informed choices based on what suits them best. Overall, this project aims to improve the experience of the student in finding a study area by reducing the time to search and increasing access to places that are conducive to productivity and focus.

## Part 2: The Key Persona
Key Persona: Andrew, is a third-year undergraduate student with a busy academic schedule and extracurricular activities. Andrew often has short periods between his classes where he has to review some notes, finish small assignments, or simply relax. Since he has to walk all around the spread-out campus, his day-to-day activities require convenience and efficiency. His ideal study spot is one that's relatively quiet, close to wherever he is, and not too crowded, especially when he only has limited time between classes. This website is designed with students like Andrew in mind to find a space that fits their studying needs and to make the most of their limited time.

With its features allowing users to filter locations, types of spaces, and crowd levels, the website helps Andrew quickly find some options close to him, so he doesn't have to walk around campus looking for an open seat. More than that, Andrew likes to know in advance about such things as the noise level and accessibility of amenities—things like power outlets—since these are precisely the kinds of things that make a difference in finding just the right place to study hard or relax.

## Part 3: The Key Scenarios
### Key Scenario 1: Gap Between Classes  
Andrew has a two-hour gap between his morning and afternoon lectures and needs a quiet place to work on his assignment. He goes to the website and selects filters for proximity, noise level, and seating availability. The website shows him that the nearby Curtis Lecture Hall is available and has low noise levels. Andrew is able to find a seat, set up his laptop, and work productively for an hour before his next class. The website’s real-time availability feature allows him to make a quick, informed decision, maximizing his time for studying and reducing unnecessary walking around campus.

### Key Scenario 2: Navigating the Campus as a New Student
Emily, a first-year student unfamiliar with the campus layout, often struggles to find quiet study spots. She opens the app and views a map of the campus, which shows available study spaces with color-coded icons. Emily sees an open study area in the Biology building, which she didn’t know had available study spots. She selects this option, and the app provides step-by-step directions to guide her to the spot. Thanks to this feature, Emily is able to find a quiet place to study without feeling lost or overwhelmed, making her transition to campus life smoother and more comfortable.

### Key Scenario 3: Late-Night Study Session
A group of students who are working on a group project decide to pull a late-night study session to finalize their work. They need a secure area, open for 24 hours, with facilities like power outlets and enough seating for the whole group. The website tells them which study spots are open 24 hours, so they can pick a study room in Vari Hall that's safe to access at night and has everything they need. By helping the group find a convenient and secure area to study, the website keeps them productive even in late hours and makes them feel secure about studying late on campus.

## Part 4: The Key Principles
Key Principle: User-Centric Design
The entire project focuses on a design that is user-centric and focused on simplicity, accessibility, and reliability. That means the website should not create any unnecessary barriers for the students to find suitable study spots. This means ensuring core information—availability, proximity, and characteristics of each study spot—are clear, accurate, and readily available within the interface. With ease of use in mind, the app can reduce frustration, save students time, and increase better campus-wide use of underutilized spaces.

The design also integrates features that are critical to students when making a fast decision, including real-time availability updates and filtering options on aspects such as noise levels, the number of seats, and access to facilities.
This aligns with the objective of creating a seamless experience that will minimize the need for students to randomly visit different locations. Additionally, through the feature of giving rates and feedback on study spots, the website turns into a collaborative platform where users help each other locate the best study environments, hence fostering a sense of community and shared experience on campus.

This will, in the end, reduce the stress of searching for study space and contribute to a supportive campus environment where students can readily have access to resources that contribute to academic success.
