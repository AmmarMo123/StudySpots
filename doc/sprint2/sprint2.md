## Meeting goals
Thoroughly plan Sprint 2, ensuring the sprint goal is well-documented, all spikes are clearly identified, decisions on user stories to be completed are finalized, and tasks are fully broken down. //TODO CHATGPT

## Sprint goals
Complete the development of all the user stories (more details discussed in the section below).

In summary, our focus is on addressing all features related to user location and mapping, including retrieving the user's location, ordering spots by proximity, and displaying a visual map with pins.

## Spikes
After some research and investigation, the uncertain areas and risks of the project include:
- Researching various free map APIs to include in our webapp, and how much control we have (in terms of adding pins and adding the option of moving the map around).
- Editing existing code to support new features (adjust the database to include coordinates, updating and styling the frontend).

## User story decisions
The user stories we are addressing this sprint are:
- (1) Get User Location
- (6) Show Map of Areas
- (7) Label Map with Colour-Coded Pins for Status of Spots/Buildings
- (9) Move Interactive Map Around to Explore Different Areas
- (10) Sort Spots Based On Location

## Task break down
The task breakdown for each sprint are as follows:
- (1) Get User Location
  - Get the user location in real time in the front end. This will involve figuring out if an api is needed and understanding chrome permissions.
- (6) Show Map of Areas
  - Determine map API to use, and include it in the front end.
  - Style it nicely so that front end is visually appealing.
- (7) Label Map with Colour-Coded Pins for Status of Spots/Buildings
  - Configure the API to add pins regarding the buildings in the frontend.
- (9) Move Interactive Map Around to Explore Different Areas
  - Configure the API to be able to move the map around in our web app.
- (10) Sort Spots Based On Location
  - Update the database to include the location of each spot, including implementing a script to determine the locations.
  - Sort based on location in the front end, this will require getting the user location (user story 1).
