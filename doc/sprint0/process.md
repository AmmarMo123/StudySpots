● Reflect on how your team worked together.
 - TODO
● Here are a few questions that can guide you
● How did you organize the team? Which tools did you use, if any? *******
 - Discord
 - Trello
 - Meetings to discuss ideas, user stories and tasks, and check ins to share prgress and blockers
 - Set internal deadlines for tasks
 - Discuss clear goals
● How did you make decisions? ********
 - Layout tasks
 - We gave everyone an opporunity to share ideas and opinions, and we made sure everyone was heard
 - Everyone has different expertise (e.g. backend, frontend, product management), so we assign decision-making authority to members who are best equipped to make the choice based on expertise or responsibility for that area. 
- We decided based on what the majority of the team preferred for areas that we're all equally equipped in (didn't need a voting system becaus ewe are only 3 members)
● How did you define priority and/or points of user stories? How many rounds of voting
(on average) did you need to come to a consensus for the point estimate? **********
 - Priority is based on the impact a story will have on users and the business. Stories that provide immediate, high value (like core features) are prioritized.
 - Stories that unblock or enable other tasks are given higher priority.
 - Wem did not need a voting system, since we are only a team of 3 and we came to decisions easily. However, we did use majority preference for points of conflict.
● How frequently did you meet? **********
 - We have a main sprint meeting at the beginning of this sprint, where we discussed vlaues, goals, etc etc
 - Quick 30min - 1hour standups every day for 4 days, to discuss progress, blockers, and anything else that arises
● What lessons should you take forward to the next phase? **********
 - Emphasize Clear Requirements and Scope Definition
 - Enhance Organization and time management
